# iOS-OlaMundo-Swift
My iOS app playground (Objective C)
Tutorial I followed was this one: [Hello World! Your first iOS App in Swift](http://www.codingexplorer.com/hello-world-first-ios-app-swift/)

You'll notice that some files have the label `Created by <someone-else-who-is-not-Catzie>` and that's because of the previous owner of the Mac I'm using. He's an old friend who left us for Maldives and hasn't shown his face since then.
